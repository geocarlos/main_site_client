That means to say that at least 100 million Brazilians use the Internet, and there may be a significant number among them interested in your product or service."

        "content": "However, if you consider trying to reach Brazilian clients/customers, there is something important that you must know: Brazilians love English names, but they do not like to speak, write, listen or read in English or, maybe, in any foreign languages. According to O Globo, only 5 percent of Brazilians are proficient in English, and only 36 percent of those who claim to speak English fluently are actually fluent. Therefore, having your business website, app, catalogues, brochures, etc. translated in Portuguese is very important and probably crucial for your business to succeed in Brazil."
